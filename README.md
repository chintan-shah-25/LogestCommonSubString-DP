LogestCommonSubString-DP
========================
Given two strings x = x1x2    xn and y = y1y2    ym, we wish to find the length of their longest
common substring, that is, the largest k for which there are indices i1 < i2 <    < ik and
j1 < j2 <    < jk with xi1xi2    xik = yj1yj2    yjk.
We can use the Dynamic Programming to find it in O(mn) time.
Please see the java file for implementation.
